```{julia}
a = Real[]

push!(a, 1); push!(a, 2.0); push!(a, π)

```

Since `Real` objects can be of arbitrary size and structure, `a` must be represented as an array of pointers to individually allocated `Real` objects. With concrete type `Float64`, `b` is stored as a contiguous block of 64-bit floating-point values that can be manipulated efficiently.


```{julia}
b = Float64[]

push!(b, 1); push!(b, 2.0); push!(b,  π)
```
